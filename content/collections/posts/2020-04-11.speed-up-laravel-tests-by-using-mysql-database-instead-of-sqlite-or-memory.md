        text: 'For many Laravel developers, one of the first things they do when they setup a new Laravel project is setup their feature tests to use an in-memory SQLite database. Using this type of database has some advantages over a traditional MySQL database such as less configuration, your tests "just work", they run faster than a traditional database. However, there are also some disadvantages as well:'
