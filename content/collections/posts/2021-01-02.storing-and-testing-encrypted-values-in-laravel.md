        text: 'When writing web applications, there are times where you''ll need to store an encrypted value in the database. One example might be a secret token that you want extra security around in case your data is exposed. Furthermore, once you''ve stored the encrypted values, you''ll probably want to test that they''re actually stored encrypted instead of in plaintext.'
