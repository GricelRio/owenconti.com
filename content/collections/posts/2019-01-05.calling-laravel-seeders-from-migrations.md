excerpt: 'Seeders in the Laravel framework allow you to populate your database with fake/seeded data. As you probably know, you can call a seeder from within a migration using Laravel. This technique is used when you have data in your database that is critical to your codebase, like permissions. Permissions are referenced in your codebase, so they must exist in your database at all times as well.'
